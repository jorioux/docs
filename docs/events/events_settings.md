# Events Settings

You may configure event behavior by adjusting the available settings.

## Disable Waitlist

To prevent members from joining a waitlist when an event reaches capacity, you may disable the waitlist feature. With the waitlist disabled, additional members will not be able to subscribe or join a waitlist once the event is full.

## Season Subscriptions

The [Season Subscriptions](recurring_events.md#season-subscriptions) feature is available exclusively for [recurring events](recurring_events.md), allowing for advanced subscription management.

## Joining Unlocks On

You may restrict when users can join an event by specifying an unlock date. Before this date, users attempting to join will see a message indicating when registration will become available.

## Event Cost

When an event cost is specified, all participants who are confirmed for the event will be charged the indicated amount after the event has occurred. **Members who remain on the waitlist are not charged.**

The event charge will be added to each member's [ongoing balance](../billing.md#members-ongoing-balance).
