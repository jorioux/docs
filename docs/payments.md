# Payments

PickleTime is integrated with Stripe to collect payments from members.

You can also collect payments by other means if you want, and manually set the payment status of your members.

## Membership Expiration

Memberships in PickleTime have an expiration date. The system provides the following features to manage expiring memberships:

1. **Notifications for Members**: Members with an upcoming membership expiration will receive a notification explaining how to renew their membership. This ensures they have ample time to take action.

2. **Administrator View**: Administrators can view a list of members with upcoming membership expirations. This allows them to follow up with members or take necessary actions.

3. **Participation Rules**: Rules can be configured to prevent members with expired memberships from participating in events. This ensures that only active members can register and attend events.

These features help maintain an organized and efficient membership management system.

## Members Ongoing Balance

This feature allows you to track individual member balances for event participation.

When a member signs up for an event, like a tournament or a clinic, the cost is automatically added to their ongoing balance. Think of it like a running tab just for their event fees.

And if you receive payments through other methods (like cash or e-transfer), you can manually adjust a member's balance to reflect those payments.

        The ongoing balance feature can be enabled or disabled at any time from the admin dashboard.
