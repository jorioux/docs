# :fontawesome-regular-sun: Seasons

Seasons allow members to subscribe to weekly time slots before the season starts. This feature enables clubs to manage recurring events and collect payments in advance.

## Introduction

### Open Pre-Season Subscriptions

When a season's subscriptions are open, members cannot subscribe to individual events directly from the regular schedule. All subscriptions for events within that season must be made through the **Season Calendar**. This is to ensure members subscribe to the entire Event Series for the season, rather than picking and choosing individual dates.

 * Action: Members must navigate to the Season Calendar.

 * Outcome: Subscribing to an Event Series from the Season Calendar subscribes the member to all events within that series for the entire season.

### Closed Pre-Season Subscriptions

When a season's subscriptions are closed (or were never open), members have more granular control over event subscriptions, but with specific limitations.

 * **Events a member already subscribed to via the Season Calendar**: A member can freely subscribe and unsubscribe from these individual events.

 * **Events a member didn't subscribe to via the Season Calendar**: A member can only subscribe to these events if they are part of an EventSeries that had a $0 cost for a season subscription.

* **Important Note**: Even if the cost was $0, an admin has the final say. They can configure the platform to deny single event subscriptions (drop-ins) for a $0 Event Series.
