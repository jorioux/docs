# :fontawesome-regular-sun: Seasons

Seasons allow members to subscribe to weekly time slots before the season starts. This feature enables clubs to manage recurring events and collect payments in advance.

## Introduction

### Open Pre-Season Sign Ups

When pre-season sign ups are open, members cannot subscribe to individual events directly from the regular schedule. All sign ups for events within that season must be made through the **Pre-Season Calendar**. This is to ensure members subscribe to the entire time slots for the season, rather than picking and choosing individual dates.

!!! info "Season Calendar"
    To learn more about time slot selection workflows and registration types (First Come, First Serve vs Seniority Priority), see the [Season Calendar](season-calendar.md) page.

 * Action: Members must navigate to the Pre-Season Calendar.

 * Outcome: Subscribing to a time slot from the Pre-Season Calendar subscribes the member to all events within that series for the entire season.

### Closed Pre-Season Sign Ups

When pre-season sign ups are closed for the active season, members have more granular control over event participation, but with specific limitations.

 * **Events a member already subscribed to via the Season Calendar**: A member can freely subscribe and unsubscribe from these individual events.

 * **Events a member didn't subscribe to via the Season Calendar**: A member can only subscribe to these events if they are part of an Event Series that had a $0 cost for a season sign up.

* **Important Note**: Even if the cost was $0, you can configure the platform to deny drop-ins for free time slots.
