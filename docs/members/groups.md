# Groups

Groups allow for easier management of members.

Administrators can send messages to groups, assign groups to events, and create rules within groups.

## Add members to groups

You can add members by selecting them, then from the Bulk Actions button, select "Add to group".

This simplifies management by eliminating the need to handle individual members separately.
